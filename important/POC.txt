1. Update composer.phar using following command 
php composer.phar self-update 

use 
php composer.phar self-update --rollback to retrun to previous version 

2. Install Symfony2 in local

composer create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition my_project_name "2.3.*"

ex: php composer.phar create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition rest/  "2.3.*"   

3. Install jms/serializer-bundle 

composer.phar require jms/serializer-bundle @stable

ex: go to website directory and execute below command 
 php ../composer.phar require jms/serializer-bundle @stable   

*** this will take care the representaion of our resources. Converting objects in to JSON or xml

4. Install friendsofsymfony/rest-bundle @stable 
php ../composer.phar require friendsofsymfony/rest-bundle @stable

Will make the the api implementaion easier. Taking care most of the standard stufs. 
and allowing us to focus on just the business logic. 

5. Generate the demo bundle: 
php app\console generate:bundle Symfony/DemoBundle

6. Register the above two bundles in AppKernal class. 
     new JMS\SerializerBundle\JMSSerializerBundle(),
     new FOS\RestBundle\FOSRestBundle(), 

7. We need a resource to work with. So We create a User entity with some fields. 
use: 
php app\console doctrine:generate:entity
Then Symfony/DemoBundle:User
Then create few fields: username, password, email 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 
8. Do following conigurations for FOSRestBundle 
1. Enable some listeners (FOSRest bundle ship with set of diffrent listners)
* format_listener - Simplifies the management of the response format.
